What is a bullet?

Should there be a central entity framework? There will be multiple weapons (bombs, missiles, etc.) perhaps eventually, so I don't think so. There should be ships, bullets, etc. with their own draw functions. These entities should be shared between all nodes, while drawn on individual nodes. 

CX means core X, which is used for the server (it's the "core" of the information)
X means local X.
